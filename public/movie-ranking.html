<h3>The Avengers</h3>

<p>I really felt goosebumps when I watched the movie for the first time on my phone. It was a really great feeling to watch all the
    og avengers in one single frame. This is the movie that made me a Marvel Fan! I still wish I could watch it in theatres.
</p>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>

<p>This has to be the best Avengers Movie till date. I also think no other Marvel movie could top this mone.We lost 
    so many characters and it was so painful to watch. It was like the best thing in 2019 and is truly and end 
    of an Era.

<h3>Hera Pheri</h3>

    <p>Lastly Hera Pheri has got to be the best hindi movie of all times. No movie can top the level
    of dialogues, acting. comedy-timing. Right from the casting to the end the movie is PERFECT.
